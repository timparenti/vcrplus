Subject: VCRplus+ Code that wants to be free

I'm not an expert on anonymous posting/distribution, so I'm
requesting your help with this.

Background:

In 1992, Ken Shirriff, Curt Welch and Andrew Kinsman published
a partial analysis of the VCRplus+ "PlusCode" coding scheme
in Cryptologia 16(3) July 1992, pp 227-234.

They figured out the codes of length 1 through 6, but didn't
break the 7 and 8 digit codes.

Later, programs implementing their logic appeared on the net,
adding encoding as well as decoding.

New stuff:

This program expands on those programs, and does the 7 and 8
digit codes, which includes TV/cable channels over 64 and
times not an even multiple of 30 minutes, and/or not lasting
an even multiple of a half hour.

It is therefore useful for personal recording of local sources at
non-round-number times or on non-broadcast channels, and for
generating codes that aren't in the newspaper.

The (encoding) algorithm is not fast enough to be used for
commercial purposes, having a brute-force section in it.  But
someone might be able to improve on that.

I am not breaking any confidentiality agreements.  I have no
access to inside information on the system.  This was done
by reverse engineering.

Please consider posting this on cryptome, under the crypto
category.
